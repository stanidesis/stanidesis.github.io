Your future reader sighs as her stomach rumbles, she’s dealing with a problem and she’s too embarrassed to ask someone for help — she has nowhere to turn. So she does what we all do: she opens the Internet. She opens Google.

She desperately pounds her search in one letter at a time: "[lack toast and tolerant symptoms](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/su6ok/lack_toast_and_tolerant/)," and slams the return key. Sure, she may not know the term is actually lactose intolerant, but your content won’t judge her, and neither will you.

Your content defines the symptoms of lactose intolerance, provides treatment recommendations, and clarifies (without condescension) that lactose intolerance is a treatable medical condition, and that lacking both toast and tolerance is a rare, but frightening personal condition. Everyone loves toast.

Your reader chuckles to herself as she realizes her mistake and connects with your polite, well-researched content. She spots your link to a product that can ease her symptoms and prevent future issues. She follows it, orders the Lactaid pills, and you earn a nice commission and a brand new fan.

That’s the power of content and great content ideas. **You may not have a health blog but you have a small business or you market for an organization that knows content can deliver wonderful experiences and attract new customers.**

And if you’re looking for content ideas that can deliver on that promise, you’ve come to the right place.
