If you’ve ever sat down to create a content strategy, you probably came face-to-face with a calendar. Empty, numbered squares demanded you fill them with titles for blogs, infographics, videos, presentations, and podcasts.

After hours of bouncing ideas around, you lined up the authors, settled the titles, and most importantly: filled those desperate little squares. You breathe easy, the square-filling-gods accepted your sacrifice… for now.

But why perform this ritual at all? Why do the squares need filling, the posts need publishing, the videos need editing, the titles need crafting?

Too often, brands treat content like a product; a product that requires a release schedule, frequent updates, timely arrivals, and a bevy of requirements. This environment of make-work marketing keeps us busy and checks off ‘necessary’ boxes. But does that content attract new leads? Does it build our brand? Does it do anything other than satisfy our need to feel productive? If you’re reading this, then your answer is probably, ‘I have no clue.’

I want you to stop thinking about content like a product, and start seeing it as a plant; a plant whose seed you bury, water, and grow into part of your brand ecosystem. And just like a real ecosystem, your brand requires a variety of plants to perform different functions: grow food, release oxygen, and support native wildlife.

The functions we need our content plants to perform include attracting new customers, educating leads, and nurturing their relationship with us long after their first purchase. And if plants are content, then this course will teach you to garden.

Okay, enough plant analogies because you’re smart and my analogy is a B- at best. During this course, you will discover a system that helps you **create content with a purpose** and determine whether your content fulfills its purpose.

I break content strategy down into a marketing funnel where three types of content coexist:

- **Top-funnel**: attracts brand new prospects to your business
- **Mid-funnel**: teaches customers about your brand, products, services, and encourages them to convert to paying customers
- And **Post-funnel**: continuously improves the customer experience and builds their relationship with your brand

At each stage, you will learn to measure the return on your investment for every piece of content by looking to **Google Analytics**. Along the way, we will focus on how the three elements of the funnel differ between B2B and B2C organizations. For a closer look, we study the content strategy of B2B marketing giant, [Mailchimp](https://mailchimp.com/), and B2C Silicon Valley food-darling, [Imperfect Produce](https://imperfectproduce.com/).
