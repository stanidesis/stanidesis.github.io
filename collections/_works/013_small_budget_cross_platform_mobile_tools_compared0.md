After the release of platform 10, OutSystems found themselves added to a class of tools which industry analysts Gartner refer to as MADP: mobile application development platforms. However, OutSystems lacked content targeting users of similar tools, tools that enable mobile application development beyond native offerings Xcode and Android Studio (from Apple and Google, respectively).

These non-native tools are more commonly known as 'cross-platform development tools;' they permit developers to build an application from a single codebase yet publish to multiple platforms: iOS, Android, Windows. These non-native mobile development tools provide a singularly unique advantage over their native counterpart: code reusability.

By writing a single mobile-targeted web app within these platforms, developers could publish to multiple device targets without re-writing their app from scratch. Even in the worst case, developers still reuse approximately 50-70% of code when building an app for multiple platforms using these technologies.

## The Plan

After performing keyword research, the plan was to provide a lengthy comparison of cross-platform mobile application development tools organized by budget: free or cheap, small-business, and enterprise (that's where my client came in).

I generated a long list of tools and researched each one. I summarized how each tool performed its job, listed pros/cons, and provided meta-details.

## The Result

Against my wishes, the post was ultimately split into three: free, small-budget, and enterprise mobile development tools. Despite the significant draw-back of limiting each list to a budget ('small-budget' and 'enterprise' were not associated with searches for cross-platform mobile development), the free piece performed exceptionally well.

As of this writing, the free comparison piece [ranks 5th for 'cross-platform mobile development,'](/assets/images/collections/works/012-free-cross-platform-madp-tools-compared/cross-platform-mobile-results.png) a term which receives 2,900+ monthly searches.
