My *Why Developer's Fear Low-Code* series inspired this talk presented at NextStep 2017. I drafted an original presentation that summarized the objections developers raise when confronted with low-code platforms.

In this presentation, my primary goal was to entertain the audience. The subject matter was less technical than the audience expected and therefore, I believed, warranted a softer approach.

I had a lot of fun creating this talk. And the audience, despite early morning business-conference disinterest, found the presentation engaging and (moderately) valuable.
