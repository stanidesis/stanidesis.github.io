OutSystems noticed a lack of articles among a topic of significant interest to them and their clients: digital factories. As I discovered, a digital factory is a sort of internal IT startup designed to perform a digital transformation of one or more business functions.

I took this new knowledge and used it to design a listicle of 10 fictitious articles about digital transformation. This was a purposeful play on listicle-style content (in particular, the pieces I produced about <a data-resource="work" data-work="016">AI</a> and <a data-resource="work" data-work="017">DevOps</a>). The final piece is an at times funny, at times bizarre piece of content that helped associate OutSystems with digital factories.
