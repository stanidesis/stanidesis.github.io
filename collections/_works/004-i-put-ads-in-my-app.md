As a fledgling app, Quotograph struggled to find its audience, so I had to sunset the product I put so much love into. But before I threw in the towel, I released this piece of content to attract attention to Quotograph's store listing.

This piece came from a sincere place of disappointment. Injecting ads into Quotograph went against everything I believed in, or so I thought. The process impacted Quotograph's performance and yet I still marched on. This post detailed my experience of integrating AdMob into Quotograph and how I felt about doing so.

## Impact

However, as a piece of content created early in my marketing career, it was misguided. The target audience of the piece did not overlap strongly with Quotograph's ideal user and thus led to few, if any additional downloads despite garnering 9k views.
