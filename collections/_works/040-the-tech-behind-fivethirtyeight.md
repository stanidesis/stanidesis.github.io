Codecademy's new [*Data Visualization with Python* Intensive](https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/data-visualization-with-python) is all about putting numbers to good use, much like what FiveThirtyEight does with their election and poll-tracking visuals.

The interactive charts generated by this site feel almost as valuable as the numbers they represent -- that kind of power can be in the hands of students, students who master data visualization with python.
