This email invited recipients to consider Codecademy's new [*Data Visualization with Python* Intensive](https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/data-visualization-with-python). In it, I note that while data can provide truth and insight, it takes a powerful visual aide to deliver that insight.

Aides that students can create using data visualization techniques.
