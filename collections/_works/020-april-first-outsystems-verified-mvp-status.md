In 2018, OutSystems chose to play a prank on their MVPs (most valuable client developers). They pitched me the idea of a special status for MVPs, a status that grants them bonus privileges. To acquire the status, they must first tattoo a depiction of the OutSystems community mascot onto their bodies.

This information was to be disseminated via press release. I took on the challenge of drafting this release and bundling with it a sense of humor. Enjoy. ;)
