I took a risk with this email by writing one of the most confounding subject lines ever (if you've never seen SQL before, that is).

As an odd sort of hook, we explained the subject line (a SQL query) and went further into how SQL fits into the workplace to better promote Codecademy's new [*Learn SQL from Scratch* 6-week Intensive](https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/learn-sql-from-scratch).
