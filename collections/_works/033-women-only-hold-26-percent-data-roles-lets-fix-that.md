This email inspired potential students to check out Codecademy's new [*Data Visualization with Python* Intensive](https://www.codecademy.com/pro/intensive/data-visualization-with-python).

In the email, we discuss the fact that only one in four data roles are held by women, and Codecademy's role in filling the gap by educating a diverse group of data analysts and scientists.
