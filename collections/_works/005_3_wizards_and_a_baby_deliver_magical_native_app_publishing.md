A ghostwritten story for OutSystems about a small development team working overtime to build a critical feature into their platform. With 1-click mobile deployment, this feature allowed developers to package their applications as native mobile executables with a single click.

I took the impassioned story of the team's lead and turned it into a fun piece of content for the OutSystems blog.
