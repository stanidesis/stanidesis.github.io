In this 16-part course, I wrote, edited, screen-casted, and starred in video checkpoints designed to lead a complete beginner to build their first Android application, TopQuiz.

The original contents of this course were written in French and I translated and re-created screencasts for an English audience. However, no one told me to pinch my fingers in the air every two seconds... that was all me.
