As part of the collaboration with SitePoint, OutSystems tasked me with designing 3 banner ads to go with the article, *<a data-resource="work" data-work="019">Low-Code Mobile Basics with OutSystems</a>*. I chose the landing page destination, designed mockups for the banners, and wrote the copy for each one.
