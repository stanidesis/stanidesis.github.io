OutSystems customers were itching to host hackathons of their own after seeing OutSystems conquer so many of the events by employing their own technologies. The request was so common that the content team drafted a hackathon starter kit e-book. And this e-book needed a landing page.

{Cue my intro music}

For this project, my role involved generating a layout mockup (linked above) and drafting the copy for the page. Among OutSystems' clients, this page and the accompanying e-book provided a great introduction to hackathons and how to host them.
