Your future reader sighs as her stomach rumbles, she’s dealing with a problem and she’s too embarrassed to ask someone for help — she has nowhere to turn. So she does what we all do: she opens the Internet. She opens Google.

She desperately pounds her search in one letter at a time: "[lack toast and tolerant symptoms](https://www.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/su6ok/lack_toast_and_tolerant/),” and slams the return key. Sure, she may not know the term is actually lactose intolerant, but your content won’t judge her, and neither will you.

Your content defines the symptoms of lactose intolerance, provides treatment recommendations, and clarifies (without condescension) that lactose intolerance is a treatable medical condition, and that lacking both toast and tolerance is a rare, but frightening personal condition. Everyone loves toast.

Your reader chuckles to herself as she realizes her mistake and connects with your polite, well-researched content. She spots your link to a product that can ease her symptoms and prevent future issues. She follows it, orders the Lactaid pills, and you earn a nice commission and a brand new fan.

That’s the power of content and great content ideas. You may not have a health blog but you have a small business or you market for an organization that knows content can deliver wonderful experiences and attract new customers.

And if you’re looking for content ideas that can deliver on that promise, you’ve come to the right place.

In This Course, You Learn…

The basics of SEO (search engine optimization)
How to perform keyword research
To evaluate keywords and turn them into content ideas
To study your competition for missed content opportunities, and
How to make a great first impression with content
And along the way, you will become familiar with this indispensable free toolkit:

- Google Sheets
- Keywordtool.io
- Keywords Everywhere
- SEOQuake
- Keyword Shitter (crappy name, useful tool)
- AdWords Keyword Planner (free account required)

This course is great for beginners who’ve done little-to-no keyword research or search engine optimization. However, you will get a head-start if you:

1. Have access to Keyword Planner

Go through these preliminary steps and then meet me in the course! As an instructor, I want to remain open and available to you. I will read and do my best to reply to all of your questions and concerns.

Happy content-ing! Also, make sure to keep a piece of toast on you at all times, otherwise your risk of sudden onset lack toast and tolerance goes up by 50%!
