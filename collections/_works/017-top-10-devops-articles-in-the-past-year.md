Another articles commissioned by OutSystems to help broaden their known expertise. In this piece, I researched and compiled top articles about DevOps -- a topic of which I am, unfortunately, largely unfamiliar.

I used BuzzSumo to discover trending articles on the topic and my own personal take to interpret the content I found. The result is a pleasant, if potentially misinformed blog post about the state of DevOps in 2017-2018.
