While working at Bloc as a curriculum author and director, I occasionally set my sights on growth. Our in-house marketers wanted to capitalize on the release of Apple's Swift programming language and they looked no further than the curriculum team.

My manager assigned this project to me and my gears began to turn. I knew that a tutorial was the way to go, but was uncertain of what to build. As a former mobile game developer, my mind ultimately settled on one of my favorite pastimes: gaming. And one of my favorite all-time games is, of course, Tetris.

Swift was a brand new language that I had no experience with, so I turned to expert iOS advice to build my game. I adapted a tutorial posted on [RayWenderlich.com](https://www.raywenderlich.com/180638/how-to-make-a-game-like-candy-crush-with-spritekit-and-swift-part-1) to build a Tetris game written in Swift.

I designed the gameplay, orchestrated each checkpoint, and wrote the content. And [Joey Kirk](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joeykirk/) created the Bloc-branding-inspired assets found in the final game; the result was beautiful.

## Impact

After release and subsequent promotion, Swiftris became the most successful piece of inbound content for Bloc. Swiftris attracted thousands of visitors to the site for months on end. The project delivered on the promise of riding the wave of excitement for Apple's new programming language.
