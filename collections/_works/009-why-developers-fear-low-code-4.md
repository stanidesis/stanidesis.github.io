In this four-part series, OutSystems wanted to combat developer objections to low-code with a series of articles that connected with the managers of those developers. The team leads, architects, and upper-brass who bought into the OutSystems pitch often found themselves beating their heads against the wall when it came time to get buy-in from developers.

This article and the series it belongs to diagnose the most common anti-low-code arguments provided by developers. In these pieces, I also attempted to offer counter-points and methods for combatting each concern.
