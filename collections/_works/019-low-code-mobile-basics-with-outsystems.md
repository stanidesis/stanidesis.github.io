As part of an experimental outreach campaign, OutSystems commissioned an article for publication on partner portal, SitePoint. The SitePoint audience is highly-technical and familiar with advanced software topics, so I chose to introduce them to OutSystems mobile development via step-by-step tutorial.

I designed the software, tutorial content, and video that accompanied the tutorial and the final product.
