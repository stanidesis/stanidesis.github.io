In one of my first assignments for OutSystems, I ghostwrote a piece that detailed how nature chose to dig a gaping hole into Hugo Louren√ßo's ceiling, and Hugo responded by plugging it up with a dazzling grid of electric lights.

The purpose of this story was to associate OutSystems' brand and products with the Internet of Things (IoT) trend. The result was a fun piece about a father who tinkered with electronics to turn his humble country house into a dream home for his kids.
