Before you dig your claws into this worksheet, I want you to ask yourself two questions: _what is a content strategy_ and _why do I suddenly have claws?_ I can‚Äôt help you with that second one, Wolverine, but if you‚Äôre drawing a blank on the first, let me lend you a claw-free hand: **a content strategy supplies a set of guidelines that prevent you from producing ineffective content**; content you might otherwise create to fill a calendar or merely keep yourself busy.

Since you‚Äôre reading this, you are interested in some structure to your content marketing; a strategy ‚Äî and that‚Äôs great because [I recommend every marketer employs one](https://www.stanleyidesis.com/why-need-a-content-marketing-strategy). But before you continue, you should be aware that this worksheet bases itself off of a _specific_ content strategy, while many others exist.

## Alternative Content Strategies

If you ping your company‚Äôs team leads every Friday morning in the desperate hope of discovering some tweet-worthy events that occurred in the past workweek, that‚Äôs _technically_ a strategy, but doubtless a flawed one. Luckily for you, principled and guided strategies exist to ease your anxiety and provide a framework for content creation.

Popular strategies include [HubSpot‚Äôs Hub-and-Spoke](https://blog.hubspot.com/news-trends/topic-clusters-seo), [Bryan Dean‚Äôs Skyscraper technique](https://backlinko.com/skyscraper-technique), and others. I encourage you to investigate several before choosing a direction for your content marketing efforts. And among your considerations, I hope you place the Full-Funnel Content strategy, the very strategy which this worksheet is based on.

## Why This Strategy

Full-Funnel Content (FFC) is named after its creator: a 16-time olympiad cyborg with a PhD in Contentology, Captain Von Fullf √únnel‚Ä¶ or maybe it‚Äôs named Full-Funnel because it was built on the idea that you can compose each stage of your customer funnel with content. By adhering to this strategy, you marry each piece of content with a business or marketing goal.

![Business Strategy Marries a Piece of Content üíñüíç](/assets/images/collections/posts/2019-01-25-build-your-content-strategy-with-this-worksheet/business-strategy-marries-a-piece-of-content.png)

Conversely, popular strategies appear to focus primarily on maximizing one or two metrics, like traffic or conversion rate. Whereas FFC respects the idea that content can serve various purposes and each element can come together to serve a greater whole. Lastly, Full-Funnel provides a data-driven framework to discover the return on investment for each piece. But how does it do any of this?

### How Full-Funnel Content Works

In brief, the Full-Funnel content strategy aims to attract, educate, convert, and nurture customers through content. The funnel breaks down into three sections: top, middle, and post.

- **Top-funnel** content is comprised of pieces that introduce people to your brand. They entertain, help, or otherwise provide value without hustling any sort of product. This content maximizes brand awareness and builds early trust.

Top-funnel content links or directs readers to the next type of content.

- **Middle-funnel** content educates the reader about your products, services, features, beliefs, and more.

Common middle-funnel content pieces tend to overlap with copy; they include landing pages, about us, product pages, and more. They help to convinces prospects of our value and inspire them to become paying customers.

- Finally, **post-funnel** content is anything that continues to build the relationship between you and your customers. These can be timely helpful tips, personal touches you send in the mail, or more commonplace: an FAQ section that answers customer questions (and does it well).

It‚Äôs post-funnel‚Äôs job to keep your brand in your customer‚Äôs memory and continually improve their opinion of you by being honest, helpful, timely, and never annoying.

Now that you have a rough idea of how this strategy works, let‚Äôs get to what you came here for.

## The Content Strategy Worksheet

You will need additional tools to implement the Full-Funnel Content strategy from end-to-end, but [this worksheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1u3Mvp0wE6ZLvEXvmiSr-nhFs2a4CUQhEhSBtyrzCb-8/edit) helps you evaluate your existing content (to categorize it by purpose) and generate new content ideas at each step of the way.

You can use and reuse this worksheet as often as you like, it may even become a continuous source of inspiration for new content ideas (as it has for me).<br>

## Additional Resources

If you want to learn more about the Full-Funnel Content strategy, this worksheet happens to provide the assignments for a [10-video course of the same name](https://www.stanleyidesis.com/courses/full-funnel-content), in which I go into detail about the content funnel, idea generation, calculating content ROI, and much more.

But before you go, I wanted to reveal that you‚Äôve just read a piece of my top-funnel content (gasp!); so yes, I practice what I preach. If you enjoyed this piece, you will enjoy my other resources; they cover additional content marketing topics and that just might tickle your fancy\*.
